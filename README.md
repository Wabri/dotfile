# i3Configuration

file from config/.i3

this configuration of i3wm, use package:
- i3blocks (use to create the bar)
- nautilus or thunar (file manager)
- feh (for desktop wallpaper)
- scrot (use in lock screen script)
- playerctl (increase & decrese the volume audio)
- gimp or imagemagick (to see and modify screenshoot)
- rofi (even if i use dmenu, is actualy a good substitute)
- lxappearance (i use to modify the theme)
- i3ipc-python (use this screen to avoid standby monitor in fullscreen, see https://github.com/acrisci/i3ipc-python)

i use also the fonts in the folder .fonts
