# Dotfiles

*DEVICE: Lenovo Thinkpad E470*

*OS: Ubuntu 18.04 bionic*

*Kernel: x86_64 Linux 4.15.0-23-generic*

*WM: i3*

The main purpose of this dotfiles repo is keeping track of my config file of i3. There is also some intresting script.

If you want to use this config file it's necessary to install this packages:
- feh (for desktop wallpaper): `sudo apt-get install feh`
- gnome-screenshot (use to get screenshot): `sudo apt-get install gnome-screenshot`
- [i3lock-fancy](https://github.com/meskarune/i3lock-fancy) (lock screen): `sudo apt-get install i3lock-fancy`
- playerctl (increase & decrese the volume audio): `sudo apt-get install playerctl`
- rofi (a substitute of dmenu): `sudo apt-get install rofi`
- lxappearance (to modify theme) : `sudo apt-get install lxappearance`
- arandr (to set monitor configuration) : `sudo apt-get install arandr`
- i3-battery-popup (to get battery warning) : [repository](https://github.com/rjekker/i3-battery-popup)
- light (to controll brightness) : [repository](https://github.com/haikarainen/light)
- xev (To catch keyboard events, used for brightness and audio controll bindsym) : `sudo apt-get install xev`

I also use the fonts in the folder .fonts, if you want to use that you have to copy directory .fonts in your home directory ($HOME)
(ps: you can find a lot of theme resources at https://www.gnome-look.org/ , download .tar.gz and put in .icons or .fonts)
