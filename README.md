- scrot (use in lock screen script)
- playerctl (increase & decrese the volume audio)
- gimp or imagemagick (to see and modify screenshoot)
- rofi (even if i use dmenu, is actualy a good substitute)

- arandr (to set monitor configuration)

i also use the fonts in the folder .fonts, if you want to use that you have to copy directory .fonts in your home

if you want to use spotify you can use this insctruction on https://www.spotify.com/it/download/linux/

theme for themes and icons is in: https://www.gnome-look.org/, you have to find a .tar.gz extension file and put to ~/.icons/ (if it's an icon theme) or in ~/.fonts/
